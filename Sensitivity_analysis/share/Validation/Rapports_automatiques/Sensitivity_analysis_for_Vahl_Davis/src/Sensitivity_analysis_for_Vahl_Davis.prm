Chapter {
	Title "Numerical setup" 
       Description The domain used for the numerical simulations is a square cavity with 0.01m length.  The consider fluid volume mass density  is \latex_($\rho = 1.17\, kg/m^3$\latex_),  the dynamic viscosity is $\\latex_(mu = 1.85\times 10^-{5}\, kg/m s$\latex_),  the diffusion parameter of the temperature is \latex_($\lambda= 2.62 \times 10^{-2} \,m^2/s$\latex_), the heat capacity  is \latex_($C_p = 1006\, J/Kg K$\latex_),  the thermal diffusivity is \latex_($\beta = 3.6 \times 10^{-3}\, m^2/s$\latex_), and the initial temperature is \latex_($T_0 = 278.15\, K$\latex_).  We impose no slip boundary condition of the four walls of the domain for the velocity.  For the temperature,  the top and bottom walls (i.e. \latex_($y = 0$\latex_) and \latex_($y = \ell$) \latex_)are adiabatic, and two different temperatures \latex_($T_1 = 283.15\, K$\latex_) and \latex_($T_2 = 273.15\, K$\latex_) are imposed respectively on the left wall \latex_(($x = 0$) \latex_) and the right wall \latex_(($x = \ell$)\latex_). Finally, we use an uniform grid of \latex_(6640\latex_) triangles generated by the Gmsh mesh generator.

Chapter {
	Title "Relative influence of each parameter on the temperature and on the velocity"
	Description We are interested in the influence on the state of five parameters: \latex_($\lambda$\latex_), \latex_($\beta$\latex_), \latex_($c_P$\latex_) and the boundary conditions on the temperature \latex_($T_1$\latex_) and \latex_($T_2$\latex_). 
	Description The local sensitivity approach can be used to provide an estimate of the variance of the state under the hypothesis of a small variance of the input parameters. 
	Description For our test case, we suppose that the parameters are independent of each other. This allows us to easily compute the relative influence (RI) of each parameter as follows: \latex_($ \text{RI}(a_k, Y) = \frac{Y_{a_k}^2(\mathbf{x}, t; \mu_{a_k}) \sigma^2_k}{\sum_{i = 1}^M Y_{a_i}^2(\mathbf{x}, t; \mu_{a_i}) \sigma^2_i}$\latex_).

Chapter {
	Title "Conclusion"
	Description Based on the SA, we investigated how the model response at a point is affected by a change in the boundary conditions on the temperature, the heat capacity, the thermal conductivity, and the thermal diffusivity under the hypothesis of a small variance of the input parameters. Various areas of the domain were analyzed to determine the relative influence of each parameter on temperature and velocity. The boundary conditions account for \latex_($100\%$\latex_) of the variance in the vicinity of the boundaries; in the remaining domains, the diffusion coefficient is predominant. As they appear in the equations in the same way, both parameters the diffusion parameter of the temperature and the heat capacity exhibit the same effects. The thermal diffusivity parameter dominates the velocity, especially close to the boundary; however, its influence on the temperature is minimal.
