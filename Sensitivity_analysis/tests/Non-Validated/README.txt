This work deals with the sensitivity analysis of the Navierâ€“Stokes equations, coupled with a
temperature equation (Boussinesq model).
We focused on the benchmark problem of natural convection in a square cavity, also known as the de Vahl Davis problem.
We designed here several tests in order to validate the sensitivity
part of the code when the temperature, beta_th, boussinesq_temperature, Cp or lambda are the parameter of interest (on which we consider that there is an uncertainty)
!!!! Warning: this part is not yet validated from a physical point of view. !!!!
