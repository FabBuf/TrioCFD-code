	Title "Hydrodynamic interaction of two cylinders subjected to small oscillations"	
	Author "M. A. Puscas"
	
	Description "The domain used for the numerical simulations is the one in Figure 1. As we can see from Figure 1., we have a 2-dimensional domain \latex_($\mathcal{D}$\latex_), with arbitrarily large length and width. In this domain, we have a homogeneous Newtonian incompressible fluid at rest, characterized by its volume mass density \latex_($\rho$\latex_) and its kinematic viscosity \latex_($\nu$\latex_). In fact, we have two cylinders, with radius \latex_($R_j$\latex_) and center \latex_($O_j$\latex_), oscillating at an \latex_($\Omega$\latex_) angular frequency."
	Description "This validation test case has been created to compare TrioCFD ALE results with the theoretical solution of such a problem [1]."
	Description "We investigate the force exerted by the fluid on the cylindrical tube subjected to a transverse excitation. We will seek, in particular, on the characteristics of the fluid force, represented by the added mass and damping coefficients."
	Description "A detailed analysis of the present test case  is presented in [1]."

	Title "Numerical setup" 
        Description "The domain used for the numerical simulations is the one in Figure 1. The values of the parameters considered here are E = 2, Sk = 900, r = 1. The left cylinder (\latex_($C_1$\latex_)) is fixed and the right one (\latex_($C_2$\latex_)) moves with an harmonic motion alongside the $x$-axis:  \latex_(${\bf U_2}(T) = u\sin(\omega T) {\bf e_x}$\latex_), where $\latex_(u= 0.01$\latex_)."

	Title "Conclusion"
	Description "The harmonic motion of a circular wall in a quiescent viscous fluid, has been  numerically simulated. A FEV method is applied to solve such a problem in conjunction with the ALE approach. The numerical results for the fluid force and the added coefficients are in good agreement with the theoretical COL and LS approximation solution [1]."
Description "Remark: in order to reduce the numerical error a much more refined mesh must be used!!!"
