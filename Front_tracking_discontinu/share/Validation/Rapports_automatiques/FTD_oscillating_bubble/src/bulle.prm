Objectif {
	Description "The aim of this test is to check the capability of the Front Tracking algorithm to describe the oscillations of the interface between an air bubble and the surrounding water."	
	Description "In the current state, this sheet is not really a validation sheet strictly speaking. Indeed, no advanced comparison, whether whit other CFD codes or analytical results, is made. Rather, it is a sheet which demonstrate the capabilities of TrioCFD for the modeling of this type of phenomenon. No reference is therefore given in this sheet."
	Description "By version v1.8.4, validation will be redone on this sheet in order to: \latex_(\smallskip\latex_)"
	Description "$\bullet$ Check the convergence of the results,"
	Description "$\bullet$ Resdefine the mesh if it turns out that the simulation was not converged into a mesh,"
	Description "$\bullet$ Validate the numerical results obtained with theoretical and experimental ones or those of other CFD codes,"
	Description "$\bullet$ Update the Test case and the PRM accordingly."

Pb_description {
	Description "The test deals with the presence of a bubble in a box filled of liquid. Initially, the liquid is at rest. No gravity forces are taken into account. In the calculation, the initial shape of the bubble is slightly an ellipsoidal one. It makes it be out of equilibrium, concerning surface tension forces. Its free surface is subject to oscillations. Their wavelengths are directly connected to the mass balance. To investigate their frequencies, the analytical results to be used as reference are relative to inviscid fluids. Therefore, this test-case is intended to provide a verification of the correct balance between surface tension and inertial effects which are the only effects which control the fluid motion. In addition, since the analytical results are non-dissipative, this test-case provides a tool to estimate the rate of the energy dissipation due to the modeling method. This is connected to the problem of numerical diffusion."
	Description " \latex_(\medskip \latex_) 
	Description "In this two-fluid problem, the following notations are introduced to describe the fluids and interface physical and transport properties. The two fluids are considered as non-miscible. The inclusion equivalent diameter is defined as the diameter of the sphere which volume is equal to that of the actual inclusion. Let \latex_($D$\latex_) be this diameter and \latex_($R$\latex_) the corresponding radius. The test makes sense if the physical properties correspond roughly to an inertia dominated flow with a very low viscosity for the gas and the liquid. This means that the capillary numbers based on the physical properties of each phase are very small. They are defined by:"
	Description "\latex_( $$ C_{a_{k}}\ =\ \frac{\rho_{k}}{\mu_{k}} \sqrt{\frac{D\sigma}{\rho_{k}}} $$ \latex_)"
	Description "where the subscript k = L;G denotes respectively the liquid or the gas phase, \latex_( $ \rho_{k} $ \latex_), \latex_( $\mu_{k}$\latex_) is the dynamical viscosity and\latex_( $\sigma$\latex_) is the surface tension between the gas and the liquid. Therefore, it is assumed that viscosity effects vanish when the following condition is fulfilled:"	
	Description "\latex_( $$ C_{a_{k}}\ \gg \ 1$$ \latex_)"
	Description "Rayleigh in 1879 derived the frequency of oscillations of such an inclusion. This derivation is based on the potential flow theory and is valid for any arbitrary inner and outer values of the density. This is shown for example by Lamb $[1]$, (p. 475, equation 10). The angular frequency of the oscillations is obtained for each mode by using the linearized momentum jump at the interface; it is given by:"
	Description "\latex_( $$ \omega_{n}^{2}\ =\ \frac{n(n+1)(n-2)(n+2)}{(n+1)\rho_{I} + n\rho_{O}} \frac{\sigma}{R^{3}} $$ \latex_)"
	Description "We focus on the main oscillation mode \latex_($n = 3$\latex_), which correspond to the slowest dissipation of kinetic energy. It leads to the theoretical value of 50 Hz, for the interface oscillation"	
	Description "Two calculations are made in this sheet. The differences between these 2 calculations relate only to the parameters of meshing used which will be explained in the paragraph \latex_(\textbf{Mesh} \latex_)."

	Options_modele {
		Description "This sheet deals with a generic Front-Tracking problem in the discontinuous version. It differs from others TrioCFD test cases : The problem does not state the number of equations that are enclosed in the problem.
		Description "Two equations are compulsory : a momentum balance equation (alias Navier-Stokes equation) and an interface tracking equation. The list of equations to be solved is declared in the beginning of the data file. Another difference with more classical TRUST data file, lies in the fluids definition. The two-phase fluid (Fluide_Diphasique) is made with two usual single-phase fluids (Fluide_Incompressible). As the list of equations to be solved in the generic Front-Tracking problem is declared in the data file and not predefined in the structure of the problem, each equation has to be distinctively associated with the problem with the Associer keyword.

The pressure difference between inner and outer fluid is also correctly reproduced. It seems this result could be considered as a reference calculation. One can see a time damping of oscillations. This effect is due to numerical diffusion."

Conclusion {
	Description "A too coarse lagrangian mesh to describe interface leads to wrong results. On the contrary, providing an accurate enough mesh is chosen, one can obtain results in agreement with theoretical data. The choice can be done via some options chosen in the input data."
	Description "If a first comparison with the theory allowed to show that the baltik Front-Tracking of TrioCFD is able to simulate an oscillating bubble in a promising way with the appropriate configuration, this sheet does not yet want to constitute the validation of the code."
	Description "To reach the validation stage, it is necessary to:"
	Description "$\bullet$ check the convergence in mesh of the test case"
	Description "$\bullet$ validate the numerical results obtained with more advanced theoretical results, experimental ones or those of other CFD codes,"
	Description "$\bullet$ update the Test case and the PRM accordingly."
	Description "This work is planned by version v1.8.4 (end 2021) of TrioCFD. "
