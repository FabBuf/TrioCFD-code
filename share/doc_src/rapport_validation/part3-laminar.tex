\lettrine[lines=2,slope=0pt,nindent=4pt]{\textbf{I}}{n} this third part of the document,
the test cases with laminar flows are considered.
Let us remind that a flow is laminar when the viscous forces dominates the inertial ones. 
This competition is characterized by the Reynolds number (Re) which is non-dimensional and
defined as $Re=\rho U_{0}/\nu$, where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $\nu$
is the kinematic viscosity and $U_{0}$ a characteristic velocity of the system.
A flow characterized by a Reynolds number under a critical value of 2000 (approximately)
is considered as laminar. Beyond this value, the flow is considered as turbulent.
The validation cases of turbulent flows will be considered in Part V of this document. In what
follows, three academic cases are detailed:\vspace*{0.5cm}\newline
\hspace*{0.5cm} $\bullet$ Poiseuille flow\vspace*{0.5cm}\newline
\hspace*{0.5cm} $\bullet$ Lid driven cavity flow\vspace*{0.5cm}\newline
\hspace*{0.5cm} $\bullet$ Cylinder in laminar Cross Flow for Re = 100\vspace*{3cm}\newline
