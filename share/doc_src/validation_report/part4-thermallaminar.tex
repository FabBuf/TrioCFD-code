\lettrine[lines=2,slope=0pt,nindent=4pt]{\textbf{C}}{ompared} to the previous part, the phenomena considered here will
involve thermal aspects and, in particular, the flow is still laminar.\newline
The first validation sheet of this category corresponds to the \textbf{Vahl Davis} benchmark, which is one of the
most known test case for checking the coupling between the convective and thermal phenomena.
The second one \textbf{Oscillatory convection flow} is very similar to the Vahl Davis test case but this time,
the cavity and therefore the flow are no longer symmetrical.
