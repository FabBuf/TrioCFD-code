  abstract   = {Euler-Euler simulations of two-phase flows, such as the 6-equations model adopted in many system thermal-hydraulics (STH) codes, becomes more challenging as the gas-liquid density ratio ρl/ρg increases. On structured meshes, the association of a staggered ”MAC” numerical scheme with a semiimplicit ”ICE” solution algorithm has proven particularly robust, and is currently used in the 3D modules of the TRACE, CATHARE or RELAP codes. 

However, structured meshes are too restrictive to cover a number of potential applications : apart from the CFD scale, unstructured, polyhedral meshes are also encountered at the component scale when modelling SFR subassemblies. This later case is the focus of the TrioMC code developed at CEA. In 2019, this code was reimplemented using a new numerical scheme (”PolyMAC”) designed to generalise to arbitrary meshes the main properties of the MAC staggered numerical scheme. In 2020-2021, this scheme, originally designed to solve the single-phase Navier-Stokes and energy equations, was extended to multiphase flows: physical models dedicated to sodium boiling were then implemented in TrioMC, and preliminary validation was carried out against a benchmark sodium boiling test (the KNS-37 L22 test provided by the ESFR-SMART H2020 project).},
