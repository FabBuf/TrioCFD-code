Chapter {
	Title "Recommendation to user"
	Description "This computation has been carried out with two convection schemes: Muscl and EF_stab. It's obvious from the results in this report that the EF_stab scheme gives better results than muscl, except for the turbulent viscosity profile. This profile is indeed quite far from the data given by the Sharma-Launder model. It is recommended to use the EF_stab scheme for such applications. The results with Muscl are presented in another report: Tube_turb_perio_muscl"
