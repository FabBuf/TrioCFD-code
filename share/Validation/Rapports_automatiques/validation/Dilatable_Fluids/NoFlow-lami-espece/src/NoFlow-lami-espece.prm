Objectif {
	Description "The purpose of this validation sheet is to check the mixing of species without chemical reactions."
	Description "Once convergence is reached, the mass fraction of the two species as well as the density of the mixture will be compared with the expected analytical results."
	Description "For that, one models a heated pipe in which one considers that the flow is quasi-compressible, turbulent and the gas, perfect."
	Description "This validation sheet has been established after the correction of convection-diffusion equation for mass fraction of species (in v1.8.3). The differences obtained on the mass fractions before and after the correction will be observed."

	Description "By being interested in the dynamics of the mixture, one notes that at the first moments (between 0 and 4 seconds) the convection is the dominant phenomenon. Indeed, the gas of the lower part of the cavity being initially lighter than the gas of the upper part, the latter will rise giving its place to the heavier gas. However, we can see that they are starting to mix at the interface level."
	Description "Then, from 8 seconds, diffusion dominates. The two gases gradually mix by diffusion of the species and there is no more convective movement."

Conclusion {
	Description "The results obtained with TrioCFD are in excellent agreement with the analytical results for mass fraction of the 2 species but also for the density of the mixture at the end of the calculation. Indeed, the error between the numerical and analytical results on the mass fraction of each of the species and the density of the mixture at the end of the transient is less than 0.5%."
	Description "This validation sheet therefore makes it possible to validate the very good behavior of TrioCFD on the calculation of the mixture of two species of different molar mass."
