	Title "Conclusion"
	Description "The comparison of test cases with and without the diffusion implicite option shows that the use of this option damage the order of the time schemes and their accuracy. We notice a factor above 2 for order of explicite euler time scheme and Runge Kutta time scheme.\newline "
	Description "When we study the test cases with a fixed time step, we note that both the accuracy and the order of the time schemes are better (factor 1.5).\newline"
	Description "So, even if the diffusion implicite option allows to build a scheme favourable compared to the diffusion implicite time scheme, it is advised to consider the degradation of the order of the time scheme which increases the time of resolution."
