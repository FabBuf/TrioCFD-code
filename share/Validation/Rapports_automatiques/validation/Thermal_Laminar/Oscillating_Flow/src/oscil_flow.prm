Objectif {
	 Description "A two-dimensional 'oscillatory convection flow' is studied inside a rectangular heated cavity. The physical test is similar to the previous one, i.e. the 'Convection Vahl Davis' in laminar condition, but the cavity is now non-symmetric. The results are compared with the benchmark of Behnia et al. that is published in the book of reference $[1]$. The TrioCFD simulations run on VDF and VEF meshes for several options of the convection scheme."

	Description " As a consequence of a zero Prandtl fluid, the temperature field can be determined analytically as the time invariant of a pure conduction solution. Using the thermal boundary conditions shown above, this solution is given by the function \latex_($T(x) = 1 - x\frac{H}{L}$\latex_). The Grashof number (Gr) is defined by:"
	Description " \latex_($$Gr=\frac{g\rho^2\beta\Delta TH^4}{L\mu^2}$$\latex_)"
	Description "Let us notice the presence of the factor \latex_($H^4/L$\latex_) in the definition (and not \latex_($L^3$\latex_)) because the domain is rectangular. The desired value of the Grashof Number, \latex_($3.10^4$\latex_), is obtained by tuning the different parameters of its definition. The temperature scale $\Delta T$ is expressed as \latex_($\Delta T=(T_h - T_c)=1 K$\latex_) and the reference temperature is chosen such as \latex_($T_0 =(T_h - T_c) / 2 = 0.5 K$\latex_). "

The profiles are presented for VDF and VEF along a horizontal profile for y=0.5 (centre of the cavity) i.e. 0<x<4 and y=0.5. We can observe that the three-cells structure of the vortices is calculated correctly for both discretization methods (VDF and VEF)."

Conclusion {
	Description "The simulations validate the laminar fluid flow coupled with the temperature equation with Boussinesq approximation. The TrioCFD simulations are performed in 2D on VDF and VEF grids with several options of convective schemes. The results are in good agreement with those obtained by Behnia, except for the VEF scheme with the 'EF_stab alpha=1' option. For other numerical schemes of TrioCFD, the relative errors vary from 0.22% for 'VEF/Muscl', up to 2.54% for VEF/'EF_stab alpha = 0.2'."

	Description "$\bullet$ \latex_(\textbf{Recommendations for users}\latex_)"
	Description "\latex_(\smallskip\latex_)"
	Description " The results obtained with the 'EF_stab' scheme are less good than the other ones. However the use of alpha=0.2 instead of alpha=1 improves the result significantly."
