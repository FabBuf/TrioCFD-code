Description <<EOF
\latex_(
In order to validate the thermal statistics generation, a known velocity field as a well as a temperature field is imposed over time in the case of a single phase canal (bi-periodicity and walls perpendicular to x direction). Implementation of the statistics in the C++ code is not handy and human mistakes can lead to export wrong variables. Imposing both temperature and velocity fields as an analytically integrable function allows checking the average of $\overline{uT}$ over time. The following case if thus considered:
\begin{itemize}
\item No convection, diffusion, sources or gravity which leads to zero momentum
\item No thermal convection or diffusion
\item Bi periodicity of the canal and walls in the third direction (plan normal to x direction)
\item Initial x-velocity field is initialised at $v_x = vx_ana$
\item Initial y-velocity field is initialised at $v_y = vy_ana$
\item Initial z-velocity field is initialised at $v_z = vz_ana$
\item Initial Temperature field is initialised to $T = T_ana$
\end{itemize}

Statistics from temperature .txt files are analysed. As the velocity and temperature are not evolving with time, time averaged values should be constants. Statistics are extracted from .txt to .dt\_ev file using share/PyTools3/commons/BuildStat.py.
