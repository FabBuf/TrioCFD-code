In this folder there are all the scirpts for the post-processing:

##################
# Folder Momentum:
##################
momentum_liq.py = plots the momentum equation for the liquid phase (The unsteady term is currently commented in the residue. Active it in case the simulation is still not converged and add it to the list of fields to plot).
momentum_gaz.py = plots the momentum equation for the gaz phase 
Build_time.py = It creates the statistics for the temporal derivatives (Use the moyenne_spatiale_*. files after adding the time of integration as first line in the file. The output is Nsteady.dt_ev)
BuildStats.py = It creates the statistics for all the other terms.
check_visc.py = Check the equivalence for the viscous term (not interfacial). See Report cap 7.2.1 for exact expression checked). 

##################
# Folder Rij:
##################
Tools_Rij.py = Different definition of the functions fluctuij, fluctuijk using also the phase indicator function as argument.
final.py = Last version for the Rij balance. It provides also the confront between pressure diffusion ana redistribution based on the solved and on the extended field. 
viscous.py = It checks the equality between all the viscous term. (See report for exact legend and equation)

##################
# Folder mesh_convergence 
##################
It contains all the Stats.dt_ev and Nsteady.dt_ev for the 5 meshes tested during the internship A. Bertugno. You can choose the quantity to compute the averaged values in the lines after "check" in the file residue.py . The plot of comparison between the explicit results and the assessment as the LHS is provided too. 
The file *.plt provide the plots in gnuplot for temporal and mesh convergence.  
Rij.py Do the same as before on the interfacial production.
