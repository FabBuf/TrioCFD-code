Pb_description {
	Description " Let us consider a tube of unit length, filled out with liquid water at an atmospheric pressure P=$10^5$ Pa. The liquid is assumed to contain a uniformly distributed small amount of gas (\latex_($\alpha_G$\latex_)=0.01), in the whole domain. The liquid temperature is equal to  \latex_($T_L = 354.728$\latex_) K. A velocity discontinuity is set at x = 0.5 m at initial time. We set V=-2 m/s on the left and V=2 m/s on the right of the discontinuity. We assume a thermodynamic equilibrium between the gas and the liquid phase, so \latex_($T_L=T_G$, $P_L=P_G$, $V_L=V_G$ \latex_). The solutions are shown at a time t = 3.2 ms and the computation is performed by using a mesh of 5000 cells in the x direction. In the y-direction only 1 cell is used. "

		Description "The velocity discontinuity in the center of the channel produces a mechanical expansion. In this region, we can observe a pressure decrease that could attain the saturation value (about 0.5 bar) and, consequently, generate a vapor zone. However, in this test case, we do not impose mass transfer, so we can observe the pressure decrease under the saturation value (See Figures 3 and 4). "

	Description " The simulations have been perfomed up to 0.0032s of physical time. As we can observe in Figure 4, the velocity discontinuity imposed initially at x=0.5m generates a central depression zone that propagates in both directions. As previously explained, the pressure drops below the saturation pressure, but since we have not imposed mass transfer, the pressure drops to \latex_($10^4$\latex_) Pa (see Figure 5). In Figures 5-7 we can observe the pressure, velocity and volume fraction gas profiles obtained avec TrioCFD, respectively. They are compared with the numerical profiles obtained in Rhodium-Abgrall [3], showing, in all three figures, excellent agreement. "
