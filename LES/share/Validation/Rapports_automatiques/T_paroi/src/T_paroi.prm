  	Title "Conclusions"
  	Description "We can note than the temperature gradient calculated with the Trio_U face temperature(*) is very far from the analytical one. This is due to the convection terms in the VEF discretization method."
  	Description "Because of this convection effect, the modification of the local Nusselt number as no visible effect on the wall temperature."
  	Description "When we take the wall "equivalent" temperature calculated with the thermal wall law, or the local Nusselt number (*), the $\Delta$Tw_eq is perfectly correct."
  	Description "We can assure that the total wall heat is brougth to the fluid since the mean temperature at the channel outlet is correct."
