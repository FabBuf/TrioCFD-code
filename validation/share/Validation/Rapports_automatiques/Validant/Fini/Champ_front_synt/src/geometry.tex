The geometry is very simple. We have a rectangular area $\Omega$ of length $L_x$, height $L_y$ and thickness $L_z$. We assume the flow inlet is $(0,y,z)$ and the flow outlet is$(L_x,y,z)$. We have the following definition :
\[
\Omega = \{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3 | 0 \leq x \leq L_x; \hspace{0.1cm} 0 \leq y \leq L_y; \hspace{0.1cm} 0 \leq z \leq L_z\}
\]
We take the same mesh size as Davidson, $L_x = 16 \pi$, $L_y = 2$ and $L_z = 0.5\pi$\\
