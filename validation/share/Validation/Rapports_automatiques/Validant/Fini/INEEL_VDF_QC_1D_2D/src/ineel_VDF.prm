	Description " For all runs, pressure loss is calculated by Trio_U. But the analytical calculation is made without the loss of pressure due to friction at the walls, that is why there is a difference between calculated and analytical results when there is friction. With symmetry conditions, the two results must be equal. With friction, the calculated pressure must be greater than the analytic one.  "

	Title "Pseudo 1D calculation"

	Description " For a 1D calculation, one has either to neglect the momentum conservation equation or to introduce in the data set, an artificial pressure drop. The second choice needs a little development in TRUST, in order to take into account the density variation properly. Therefore, the momentum equation is neglected. The pressure loss is not calculated. The comparison between analytical and calculated results leads to the following curves. The calculated and analytic results are superposed. "

Chapter {
	Title "Pseudo 2D (flat profile) calculation"

	Description " The simulations are performed with symmetric conditions at the walls and with an uniform velocity profile at the entry. With symmetric conditions at the walls, the different profiles in the tube are flat, as there is no friction at the wall. The difference with the pseudo-1D calculation consists in the calculation of the pressure loss via the momentum conservation equation. The comparison between analytical and calculated results leads to the following curves. Again, the calculated and analytic results are superposed."

Chapter {
	Title "Pseudo 2D (parabolic profile) calculation"

	Description " With non slip conditions at the walls and a parabolic velocity profile at the entry, the different profiles in the tube are not flat any more. The different bulk values must be calculated by averages on the cross section of the flow. For the bulk values, the analytical mass conservation equation, perfect gas equation and energy conservation equation are still verified. Thus, the bulk temperature, density and velocity are still fitting perfectly the analytical calculation (see below curves). Due to the parabolic profile induced by wall friction, the analytical momentum conservation equation is not verified any more. "
	Description " When the wall friction is added in the analytical solution, the calculation and the analytical results fit quite well at the entrance of the tube. At the exit of the tube, as the effects of compressibility are not taken into account in the friction correlations, some differences between analytical and calculated values are observed. "
