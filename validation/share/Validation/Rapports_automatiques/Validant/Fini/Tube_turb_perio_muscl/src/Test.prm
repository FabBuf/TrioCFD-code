	Title "Recommendation to user"
	Description "This computation has been carried out with two convection schemes: Muscl and EF_stab. Results with EF_stab convection are presented in the report Tube_turb_perio_EF_stab. Results from both tests show that is best to use EF_stab scheme for that kind of application. However, the turbulent viscosity curves show that is with the muscl scheme that nut is best predicted"
