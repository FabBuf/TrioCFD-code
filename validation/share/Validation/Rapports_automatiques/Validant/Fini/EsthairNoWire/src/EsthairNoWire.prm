The mesh is thinner for Re numbers from 50000 up to 200000 (first figure below) and a little coarser for Re numbers 25000 and 15000 (respectively second and third figures below). This is in order to get the adimensional distance from the wall y+ in the wished magnitude (y+ > 30 or 40)." 
		Description "Since only the pressure loss is studied, only two slices of vertical mesh are modelised. In order to get quite iso-dimension of the cells in all directions, the total height is 1.92mm for Re numbers 200000, 100000 and 50000. It is 2.5mm for Re number 25000 an 1.96mm for Re number 15000."
