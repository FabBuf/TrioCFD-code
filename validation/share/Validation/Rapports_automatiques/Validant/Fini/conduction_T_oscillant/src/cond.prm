	Title "VEF calculation of Conduction in a wall"



	description " Objectives: The aim of this file is to test the capabilities of the code to describe unsteady propagation of thermal loads within a solid."
	description "The test consists in a plane metal wall with imposed oscillating temperature at boundary. Several meshes are tested: a refined mesh, a medium mesh, a coarse mesh close to the one used for the calculation of the Plajest experiment performed in 2010, the same coarse mesh with expanded cells and a coarse mesh obtained with an industrial mesher (ICEM). Several time schemes are also used: implicit, explicit and Runge Kutta 3. In the coupled problems, the boundary condition of the solid domain is a temperature obtained from the flux balance at the previous time step. This test case is thus representative for the calculation of the solid part in a coupled problem. It is designed for the validation of the calculation of the conduction in the solid for the Plajest experiment."

Chapter {
	Title "Calculation results"
	Description "The calculations are performed with an implicit time scheme. However, as the boundary condition varies with time, it is necessary to limit the maximum time step, in order to reproduce properly the sinusoid boundary condition. For a 'clean' boundary condition, a maximum time step of 0.01s is imposed. One period of the sinusoid will be modelled with 50 points (thus 50 time steps), which is enough for the results accuracy. More generally, in the case of a sinusoid with a frequency f, limiting dt_max to 1/(50.f) leads to a proper evaluation of the time depending temperature boundary condition."
	description " For the refined and medium mesh, the initial facsec is chosen equal to 200. It rises to 454 for the fine mesh with corresponding time steps of 5.5e-3s. For the other meshes, the maximum value of dt_max=0.01s is used in the calculations."
	description " "
	description "As seen above, a decrease of 90% of the signal amplitude is done in about 1.9mm, it is thus necessary to have at least 8 calculation points (4 cells) in this interval."

	Title "Conclusion"
	description " This test case is a good validation test case for coupled problems with conduction. Like for coupled problems, the boundary condition of the solid domain is an imposed temperature."
	description " "
	description " Several time schemes are tested and compared. They show that the use of an implicit time scheme is a good choice for conduction, as long as the time step remains small enough to 'capture' properly a time depending boundary condition."
	description " "

	description "Several meshes were also calculated: a refined mesh (129600 elements)  and a medium mesh (4800 elements)  were generated with the Trio_U mesher. A coarser mesh was generated with the ICEM mesher (1492 elements). An even coarser mesh (576 elements) was generated with the Trio_U mesher. This last mesh was created in order to have the same charcteristics along the x axis as the mesh used for the calculation of the conduction in the wall for the Plajest experiment (study 2010). It was also expanded radially in order to be totally similar to the mesh used for the Plajest calculation (study 2010)."
	description " "
	description "The evolution of the amplitude decrease of Trms in the wall is calculated very accurately by the code for all the meshes."
	description "The temperatures at different points in the wall are also calculated accurately, both for the amplitude and the phase delay. The discrepancy for the the phase delay obtained with the expanded mesh is a little higher, but remains also acceptable for the calculation of the conduction in the wall. "
	description "This test case is thus a good validating test case for the calculation of the conduction in the wall."

	Title "Recommendation to users"
	description "From this validation test case, some recommendations for users can be issued for the calculation of the convection in a wall: "
	description "- The use of an implicit time scheme is recommended, but the user should limit the facsec value or the maximum time step in order to 'capture' properly a time depending boundary condition. In the case of a sinusoid with a frequency f, limiting dt_max to 1/(50.f) leads to a proper evaluation of the time depending temperature boundary condition."
	description "- The temperature and temperature fluctuation decrease near the boundary is significant. To reproduce this slope properly, Trio_U should have at least 8 calculation points in the region corresponding to a decrease of 90%, that is for the distance:   \latex_($x=\frac{Log(0.1)}{\sqrt{\frac{2.\pi f}{2\alpha}}}$\latex_) "
	description "- The mesh should be as regular as possible. Expansions of the mesh in any direction should be limited. In our case, an expansion of a factor 5 in the y and z direction is at the acceptable limit for the obtention of good results.
	description "- To avoid unexpected temperature differences, The user should position the temperature probes at the middle of the faces of the cells. The use of the 'nodes' keyword is recommended."
