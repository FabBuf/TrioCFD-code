NL2 You have to associate a modele_rayo_semi_transpNL2 You have to add a radiative term source in energy equation NL2 Warning: Calculation with semi transparent gas model may lead to divergence when high temperature differences are used. Indeed, the calculation of the stability time step of the equation does not take in account the source term. In semi transparent gas model, energy equation source term depends strongly of temperature via irradiance and stability is not guaranteed by the calculated time step. Reducing the facsec of the time scheme is a good tip to reach convergence when divergence is encountered.
